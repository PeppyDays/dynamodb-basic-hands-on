    "DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. Applications can access this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near-real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common usage is using lambda functions which are triggered by DynamoDB Streams and do further jobs in Lambda for various reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use DynamoDB Streams for game leader board to rank players in score order. Two tables will be created, one for user scoring history and the other for user total score. Threre are two known query patterns as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show the user's scoring history up to 100 latest items\n",
    "- Show the top 3 players who have the highest scores\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use DynamoDB Streams and Lambda to update user's total score in near-real time.\n",
    "\n",
